# Basic NN with GO

This is an attempt to build a simple neural network with 1 output only. This is done mostly as a learning purposes.

I'm following the tutorial from [here](https://victorzhou.com/blog/intro-to-neural-networks/)

The implementation is **far** from ideal and **may not be correct at all**.

> Please do create a pull request if you want to correct the implementation.
